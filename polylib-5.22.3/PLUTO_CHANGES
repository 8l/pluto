# Uday Bondhugula

1. Makefile.am of polylib has been heavily hacked to remove a lot of stuff 
   not needed for Pluto/Cloog. Ehrhart library, Zpolylib, and depending sources
   have been removed. This is to reduce compile time.

2. Added autogen.sh

3. Update include/polylib/Makefile (not sure why a soft-link on arith*.h files is
   attempted.

4. Removing Test/. Not sure whether it's being configured correctly.
