INSTALLING PLUTO

Requirements: A Linux distribution. Pluto has been tested on x86 and 
x86-64 machines running Fedora Core {4,5,7,8,9}, Ubuntu, and RedHat  
Enterprise Server 5.x. Solaris should also be fine if you have GNU 
utilities. In order to use the development version from Pluto's git 
repository, automatic build system tools including autoconf, automake, 
and libtool are needed. 

Pluto includes all libraries that it depends on.  autoconf/automake 
system will take care of automatically building everything. Nothing else 
needs to be downloaded and installed separately.


BUILDING PLUTO

Stable release

Run 'install from Pluto's top-level directory

$ tar zxvf pluto-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ cd pluto-0.6.0/
$ ./install
$ make test

    OR

$ tar zxvf pluto-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ cd pluto-0.6.0/
$ ./configure [--enable-debug]
$ make
$ make test

Development version from Git

$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/pluto.git
$ cd pluto/
$ git submodule init 
$ git submodule update
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure [--enable-debug]
$ make
$ make test


If you do not have ICC, uncomment line 7 and comment line 8 of 
examples/common.mk.

'polycc' is the wrapper script around src/pluto (core transformer) and 
all other components. 'polycc' runs all of these in sequence on an input 
C program (with the section to  parallelize/optimize marked) and is what 
a user should use on input. Output generated is OpenMP parallel C code 
that can be readily compiled and run on shared-memory parallel machines 
like general-purpose multicores.


TRYING A NEW CODE

- Use '#pragma scop' and '#pragma endscop' around the section of code 
  you want to parallelize/optimize.

- Then, just run 
    
    ./polycc <C source file> --parallel --tile

  The transformation is also printed out, and test.par.c will have the 
  parallelized code. If you want to see intermediate files, like the 
  .cloog file generated (.opt.cloog, .tiled.cloog, or .par.cloog 
  depending on command-line options provided), use --debug on command 
  line.

- Tile sizes can be specified in a file 'tile.sizes', otherwise default 
  sizes will be set. See doc/DOC.txt on how to specify the sizes.

To run a good number of experiments on a code, it is best to use the 
setup created for example codes in the examples/ directory

- Just copy one of the sample directories, edit Makefile (SRC = ), 
  util.h, decls.h appropriately (put your problem size declarations in 
  decls.h)

- Now, do a make (this will build all executables; 'orig' is the 
  original code, 'tiled' is the tiled code, 'par' is the OpenMP 
  parallelized+locality optimized code; 'par2d' is with two degrees of 
  parallelism whenever it exists). One could do 'make <target>', where
  target can be orig, orig_par, opt, tiled, tiled_par

- 'make test' to test for correctness


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Run

./polycc -h 

or see documentation (doc/DOC.txt) for details


TRYING ANY INCLUDED EXAMPLE CODE

Let us say we are trying the 2-d Gauss Seidel. Do a 'make par', this 
will generate seidel.par.c from seidel.c and also compile it to generate 
'par'. Likewise, 'make tiled' for 'tiled' and 'make orig' for the 
'orig'.

$ cd examples/seidel

seidel.orig.c: This is the original code (the kernel in this code is 
extracted)

seidel.opt.c: This is the transformed code without tiling (this is not 
of much use, except for seeing the benefits of fusion in some cases)

seidel.tiled.c: This the pluto tiled code (not parallelized) generated 
from the tool - this should be used for single core execution

seidel.par.c: This is the pluto parallelized + locality tiled code. This 
has OpenMP pragmas and the code is L1 tiled or L1 and L2 tiled.

seidel.par2d.c: In this case, since we have two degrees of pipelined 
parallelism, so the .par2d.c is the code with nested parallel OpenMP 
pragmas.

- To change any of the flags used for an example, edit the top section 
  of examples/common.mk or the Makefile in the example directory

- To manually specify tile sizes, create tile.sizes; see 
   examples/matmul/ for example or doc/DOC.txt for more information.  

- orig (orig_par is the icc auto-parallelized original code), tiled, par 
  and par2d are corresponding executables; they already have timers; you 
  just have to run them and that will print execution time as well

So, to run pluto parallelized version:

$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ./par

To run ICC auto-parallelized version:

$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ./orig_par

To run the original unparallelized code (compiled with icc -fast)

$ ./orig

To run the pluto tiled version (non-parallelized, local tiled)

$ ./tiled

- 'make clean' in the particular example's directory removes all the 
    executables as well as the generated codes

To launch a complete verification that compares output of tiled, par
with orig for all examples, in the examples/ directory, run

[examples/ ]$ make test
