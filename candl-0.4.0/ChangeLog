2009-02-07  Uday K Bondhugula <bondhugula.1@osu.edu>
	Computes last writer on RAW, WAW, RAR dependences. Long
	standing implementation finally committed. Last writer
	computation is only done under '-lastwriter 1' or
	options->lastwriter = 1. All code was written in Sep '08.
	Does not handle cases where the last writer function is
	split into different cases based on parameters (bails out
	without modifying dependence polyhedron)

    * source/dependence.c: Code to compute last writer
	* source/options.c,

	* include/candl/options.h

	* source/matrix.c: Move and rename function candl_matrix_dependence to
	candl_dependence_build_system.

	computation. The precedence constraints were not correctly
	computed. Bug reported by Uday Bondhugula.

2008-08-07  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch creates a .scop dumper for candl. Dependences are
	represented between the
	<candl><dependences>...</dependences></candl> tags. It is
	activated by providing a .scop file as the input (needing flag
	-inscop), and by using flag -outscop.

	* source/dependence.c: Create a .scop dumper, where the
	dependences are added in the optional tag.

	This patch finalizes the scalar analysis pass. The following
	operations are available: scalar privatization, scalar expansion,
	scalar renaming, and test for privatizability.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* source/dependence.c: Finalize scalar analysis. Add scalar
	expansion and scalar renaming. Refactor scalar privatization. Add
	dependence pruning via privatization.

	format. Loop indices are either extracted from the identity
	scheduling matrix, either from the content of the optional <candl>
	tag in the .scop file. See tests/xxx.opt.scop for examples.

	* include/candl/program.h,
