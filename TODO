Missing features

1. Unroll-jamming non-rectangular loops is not yet integrated (Orio 0.1.0)

Tool running time optimizations

1. Instead of putting c_i >= 0, c_i <= 0 for c_i == 0 when I 
add h-transformations, just put c_i >= 0, and then sigma c_i <= 0. 
This applies to (1) constructing the dependence polytope, (2) bringing
in the equalities after application of the Farkas lemma (for both 
legality and communication vol bound). [X DONE 0.3.1 release]

2. Use gaussian elimination to eliminate some Farkas multipliers.

Right now, (1), (2) are not at a concern.

3. Too many alloc's in get_stmt_ortho_.. memory leak there (dim instead
        of nvar)

4. How often to call constraints_simplify from get_permutatibility? Tune this.
