- Please make sure your code is indented the same way as surrounding code

- Use spaces instead of tabs for indenting (for vim, set expandtab). All of
  Pluto uses a 4-space indent, please try using the same.

- For if/else that have their blocks on a separate line, use braces, 
  i.e., even if the block has a single line. 

    if (...) {
       code;
    }else{
       code;
    }

    No need of braces if the then/else block appears on the same line

    if (...) code;
    else more code;


- Make sure the patch is signed and your name/email-address appears in the 
  commit (use -s with git commit)

- Please generate patch against the git version, i.e., use 

    'git format-patch -M origin' 

  and send to pluto-development@googlegroups.com or uday@csa.iisc.ernet.in
