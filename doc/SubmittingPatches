- Please make sure your code is indented the same way as surrounding code

- Use spaces instead of tabs for indenting (for vim, set expandtab). All of
  Pluto uses a 4-space indent, please try using the same. For vim, it should
  be  "set ts=4 sw=4 expandtab"

- For for/while loops, place the opening brace on the same line.

    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {


    }

- For if/else that have their blocks on a separate line, use braces (if the
  block is a single line).

    if (...) {
        code;
    }else{
        code;
    }

  No need of braces if the then/else block appears on the same line

    if (...) code;
    else more code;

- Please generate a patch against the git version, i.e., use 

'git format-patch -M origin' 

and send to pluto-development@googlegroups.com or uday@csa.iisc.ernet.in
