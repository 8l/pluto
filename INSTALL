REQUIREMENTS

A Linux distribution. Pluto has been tested on x86 and x86-64 machines 
running Fedora Core {4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}, Ubuntu, and RedHat  
Enterprise Server 5.x. Solaris should also be fine if you have GNU 
utilities. In order to use the development version from Pluto's git 
repository, automatic build system tools including autoconf, automake, 
and libtool are needed. GMP (GNU multi precision arithmetic library) is 
needed by ISL (one of the included libraries). If it's not already on 
your system, it can be installed easily with, for eg., 
'sudo yum -y install gmp gmp-devel' on a Fedora, or
'sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev' on an Ubuntu. 


QUICK INSTALL

$ tar zxvf pluto-0.6.0.tgz
$ cd pluto-0.6.0/
$ ./configure [--enable-debug]
$ make

* polycc is the script wrapper around src/pluto and all other 
components, and it is the one to run. Please refer to the README 
for more details.
